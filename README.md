### Technology

- Spring Boot
- In Memory Database (HSQL)

### Dependent Libraries

- Apache Commons Lang

### Important Takeaways

no `web.xml` required

default uses Tomcat but can exclude this to use Jetty instead

just slap on `@SpringBootApplication` annotation to Application main class

need quite a lot of maven configuration on the `pom.xml` or gradle configuration on the `build.gradle`

schema.sql file in root classpath (resources) and Spring Boot will automatically use to create database schema

data.sql file in root classpath (resources) and Spring Boot will automatically use to initialize the database

logging is automatically configured (no need for even a `log4j.properties`/`log4j.xml` confiiguration file)

adding the `spring-boot-starter-jdbc dependency` will allow you to inject `JdbcTemplate`

can add `application.properties` to resources which you can configure whole lots of properties from database to logging
